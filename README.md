## Weather App
This is a small project I did with the intention of learning the basics of
NodeJS, npm, and the free 'Current Weather' API from [OpenWeatherMap.org](http://openweathermap.org). The bot has simple functionality for now. 

I added interactivity using Yargs. It is a pirate-themed command line interface tool. You can check it out [here](http://yargs.js.org) and find out how it works [here.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs)

Fill free to check out the code!
